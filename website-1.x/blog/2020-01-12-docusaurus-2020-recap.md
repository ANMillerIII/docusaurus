2020 was a great for Docusaurus, despite [a regrettable start](https://docusaurus.io/blog/2020/01/07/tribute-to-endi) and a tumultuous year for everyone.

We continued to invest on [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), and made it reach **full feature parity with [Docusaurus 1](https://docusaurus.io/)**,

We can now safely **recommend Docusaurus 2** as the **default choice** to start a new project, and encourage v1 users to [migrate to Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/migration).

We are **still in alpha**, but expect **some good news very soon**!

## Docusaurus 2 highlights

We have worked on many features this year, and would like to highlight the most significant ones:

- **i18n**: easily translate your Docusaurus site, released soon! ([preview](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/3325))
- **Version dropdown**: enable contextual version switch
- **Versioning options**: solving the most common pain-points users had with versioning
- **Contextual search**: search in current version, use the brand-new Algolia DocSearch 3 experience
- **Markdown pages**: use Markdown instead of React components to create standalone pages
- **PWA**: add offline support to your site, and make it installable
- **Fail-fast**: strict config validation, detect broken links and prevent bad production deployments
- **Multi-instance**: use the docs plugin twice on a single Docusarus site (e.g. ios/android doc sdks)
- **Migration CLI**: automate many parts to upgrade easily from Docusaurus 1
- **CodeSandbox**: assess Docusaurus easily from your browser
- **Canary releases**: use the `@canary` npm tag to use the upcoming release before everyone else

## Docusaurus 2 growth

The plan to [rebuild Docusaurus from scratch in 2019](https://docusaurus.io/blog/2019/12/30/docusaurus-2019-recap) paid off: after a slow start, Docusaurus 2 has been widely adopted and has **already outgrown Docusaurus 1** usage.

[ReactNative](https://reactnative.dev/) was successfully migrated ([old version](http://archive.reactnative.dev/)).
